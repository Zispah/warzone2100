Changes of reworkdiff-alphacam-1.0 compared to camBalance:

----------------------------------------------------------

There are currently no changes directly targeted for Beta
campaign.

-- Scavenger structure changes:
The scavenger gun towers, scavenger walls, and scavenger
flamer towers are now much more fragile.

-- Scavenger weapon changes:
The scavenger MG is now similar to original. The scavenger
TMG and HMG is saved for Hard and Insane difficulties. On
Hard and Insane the scavenger tower MG also gets upgraded.
Scavenger flamer towers now has a lower range than the MG
and has more direct damage but less periodical damage.

Scavenger structures might look weird when they get
upgraded.

-- Bunker changes:
All weapons except flamers and bunker busters are now more
than twice as effective against bunkers. Flamers and
bunker busters are now weaker against bunkers.

Important: "Structure" in this changelog always excludes
bunkers.

-- Flamer changes:
Flamers now has a higher range and a higher projectile
flight speed. They now have more direct damage but less
periodical damage. They are now slightly weaker against
structures. (A reminder that "structure" excludes bunkers)

-- Tech placement changes:
The first scavenger base in Alpha 1 restores the
traditional MG damage upgrade. Engineering is placed in
the third base which now unlocks the repair turret.

Chaingun upgrade is now placed in the TMG's original
location and now unlocks TMG. The flamer range upgrade and
the second flamer damage upgrade is now placed in the same
artifact as the HMG.

Lancer is moved to Alpha 8.

-- Power changes:
The starting power in Hard and Insane difficulty is now
much higher, but don't get fooled, you better prepare
because the next missions are hazardous...

-- camChangeOnDiff changes:
This function mainly affects timers and enemy factory
production rates. The higher the value it returns the
easier the campaign gets. The values for easier
difficulties are reduced for it's originally too much,
while the values for higher difficulties are also reduced
to make them differ more to Normal.

-- Bunker buster changes:
Bunker busters is what breaks the difficulties of Alpha 6
onwards in camBalance. Because of that, they are now
weaker against structures but stronger against units.

-- Cannon changes:
Cannons now have a reasonable fire rate with a higher
damage per shot to compensate. Medium and heavy cannons
are now useful for they're now stronger and lighter.
All cannons are now better against structures and cyborgs.

-- Rocket changes:
The lancer is now highly similar to the original. To
balance, all other weapons are now stronger.

-- MRA changes:
The MRA is too similar to Bombard in camBalance, so they
now have more than twice the original fire rate but a
range barely higher than direct fire weapons. It's now the
artillery with the highest DPS until the Pepperpot.

-- MG upgrade changes:
The first, second and fourth MG damage upgrade are now
more effective while the third MG damage upgrade is
weaker. Rapid fire chaingun upgrade is moved from Beta 1
to Alpha 8.

There are also many minor changes but the above is all you
need to know about the mod. Have fun! :)
